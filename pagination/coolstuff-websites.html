        </a>Type: Virtual World<br>
        <p>
        Whirled was a virtual world where you could chat, play Flash games, make rooms and more. The majority of stuff in the game was user-made. Avatars, rooms, pets, furniture, games all made by users! This is a restoration of the site. Since Flash is dead you'll have to download a client to play. I used to go on Whirled all the time as a kid so there's a lot of nostalgia for me here.

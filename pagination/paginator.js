/* This paginator is designed for static websites, making it quite rare. People
don't usually do stuff like this for static websites because of how much maintenance
it requires. Every time you add content to your site, you have to update the paginator.
Sites with backend servers that can handle loading dynamic content for your site at
a simple request are far better suited to handle this sort of thing. But, if you are
set on making your static site as dynamic as possible and don't mind maintaining it,
this will work just fine for you. */

/* The paginator takes an array of links or urls to content. Each url and its corresponding
file content represent 1 item to paginate. The index is the first item in that list
of links to be displayed on a page, and the limit is how many items will be displayed
per page. */

  template or create your HTML inline and use querySelector to get a reference to it.

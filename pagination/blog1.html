    <p>This is a test blog!</p>
      <p>I've never made a blog before, don't know how much I'll use it to be honest. I wanted to try and make this thing paginated <s>but I have no clue how <img src="https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/5fd1610acbd462462d56cd7d/3x.webp" class="emote"></s> Hopefully the more I mess around here the more I learn about properly coding stuff. If anything looks weird feel free to let me know! (a lot of links are probably broken) <br>Most of the gallery is up to date and some of the links in <a href="/misc">Misc</a> have pages. (message board, old art, and the random buttons)<br>Edit: Nevermind I figured out pagination I think</p> Anyway hope you like my site

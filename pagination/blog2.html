    <p><left>Happy new year! I don't really do new years resolutions cause I get lazy and demotivated, so I just strive to be better than the last year. I do want to start doing more art for fun again, 2023 was a pretty lull year for me. <br><br>Designing this website and making stuff for it has been a lot of fun! It's nice to have a place to just put whatever out there without the anxieties I get with social media. Once I've got everything set up and run low on ideas it'll probably become a low priority though. I'd also like to delve into new hobbies, thinking about learning how to make music mostly. I've never even dipped my toes in music making despite how much I listen to, we'll see how that goes. I may also get back into streaming art this year just for fun. Even if nobody's watching I feel like it encourages me to stay productive which could be nice.<br><p>Hope everyone has had a good year and this next year treats you kindly!</p><p>side note: every time I decide to use flash for something simple like the gif above I instantly regret it lol</p></left>

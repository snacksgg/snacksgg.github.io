        <p> whenever i feel like i'm in a rut or can't get any motivation to draw, i find that playing art games can help a lot. i think it relieves some pressures of drawing that you may not always be aware of. the dreaded blank canvas, so many brush options, what should i even draw?? art games can limit some of the overthinking i have, and they're a nice little closed space to experiment with limited tools and get loose/warmup. </p></div>
        
        <h1><a href="https://drawception.com/" target="_blank">Drawception</a> & <a href="https://www.playinterference.com/">Interference</a></h1>
        <div class="tbox">
        
        
        <p>i've been participating in social art games since 2016, starting with <a href="https://drawception.com/" target="_blank">Drawception</a> . i think i found it through Jazza's video on it, or at least that's how it got popular. it's like the broken telephone game but with drawings, kinda like gartic phone, just not live. i really like Drawception, with such limited palettes and brush sizes, you really have to challenge yourself to think about shapes and values. <s>it's a shame the state it's in now, i hope it gets a rework sometime</s>.
         <br>i would recommend to try <a href="https://www.playinterference.com/">Interference</a> also, it's the same concept. just in case Drawception ends up dying, i've made a collection of all the drawings i did from 2016-2021, you can find it <a href="/images/gallery/drawceptionarchive%202016-2021.png" class="lbimg" target="_blank" >here!</a> </p> edit: Drawception is being worked on again! <img class="emote" src="/images/emotes/wahoo.png">   <br>  <a href="/images/gallery/drawceptionarchive%202016-2021.png"  target="_blank" class="lbimg" ><img alt="PanelChutney Panel" src="/images/gallery/thumbs/drawceptionarchive%202016-2021%20thumb.png" id="rounded"></a><br>

        </div>
        
        <h1><a href="https://www.differentstrokes.xyz/">Different Strokes</a></h1>

        <div class="tbox">
        next, i found <a href="https://www.differentstrokes.xyz/">Different Strokes</a> through a random cohost post. one person draws something, and another person "fixes" it by adding their own drawing on top. not much to say about this one, it's just fun to run around a virtual gallery of user-made stuff and play with the game's art tools. <a href="https://www.differentstrokes.xyz/user/snacks">here's my gallery page!</a>
        </div>
        <h1><a href="https://pchutney.com/">PanelChutney</a></h1>
         <div class="tbox">
        finally, i found <a href="https://pchutney.com/">PanelChutney</a> from a Drawception forum post about similar sites. it's a collaborative comic making site, with a lot of customization options as well as animation. this is the one i've been using the most recently, it's a really cool concept that i don't think you can really find anywhere else. the site only has ~300 users atm, so i'd love to see this site get more activity! <a href="https://pchutney.com/user/127"> here's my profile.</a>
        </div>
        
        <br><br>
        i wish these types of sites were more well known, they all have neat welcoming little communities and deserve more attention. i hope you check them out! the internet needs more fun spaces like these.<br>

                    heya! been a minute since i've done a substantial update, so i figure i'd write a little bit on my plans and reflect on the year. and uh... it certainly has been a year. i don't like sharing much personal stuff online so i'll just say its been rough. all i can hope for is some more normalcy in the new year i guess 🤷. i imagine many people feel the same in some way, so i'm not gonna dwell on it here. fingers crossed!

                    <i>Website</i><br>
                    overall, i'm pretty satisfied with how the site looks at the moment. there's a number of things i wanna focus on (reworking pages, finishing placeholders) and then i think i might put it on the backburner for a bit. updating and making stuff for here is still much more fulfilling than juggling social media, but it does get tiring sometimes. i'd moreso like to keep this as a pet project that i can slowly add to longterm. i do still have some more fun ideas in mind though! <br> <br>

                    <i>Art</i><br>
                    over the last few years, i've felt pretty mixed about my art output. on one hand, i've been drawing quite a bit more than past years, on the other i feel like my stuff is way too samey. in the new year i'd really like to experiment more and focus on improving while still trying to have fun with it. i never can predict how much i'll get done in a year, so i just hope to procrastinate less on my ideas <img class="emote" src="/images/emotes/zedsweat2.png">

                                feels obvious this would be here lol but yeah this game absolutely lived up to my expectations. it expands on the first game in so many ways and is every bit as challenging and fun.

                                Momentum Mod opened up its playtest for everyone this year! its a really neat standalone game that centralizes source game movement modes (bhop, surf, rocket jump, etc.) into one place. if you've ever been interested in these modes, i think this is easily the best place to get into it.

                                this game rules. it takes inspiration from source movement but makes it much simpler to execute on. the open level design and uncapped speed let you zoom around yet it still takes some precision to get through. the game is in early access, but what's there makes me super excited to see what the dev has planned!

                                kinda wild to think that silksong and more deltarune got released in the same year. these two alone would make a great year for games lol. anyway yep it's more deltarune, i don't have much to say other than ofc it's really good. i've especially been enjoying this game's variation of battles compared to undertale.

                                Mosa Lina got an update this year that basically doubled the amount of content in the game. i hadn't played the game before this year, but man this game is fun to play around in. it's a platformer that will constantly make you feel clever and stupid in the span of minutes. and for how replayable and deep this game's mechanics are, it's a shame it doesn't get more attention. it's also absurdly cheap!

                        i've never really gotten into vocaloid but these three songs have gotten stuck in my head. i think the rhythm heaven styled music video reeled me in. also all of these are just super well animated and fun!

                                easily my most anticipated game ever since i backed it in 2022. it feels like this game was made for me. expressive movement, stylish, colorful, challenging, i could probably go on for a while. i've clocked 14+ hours in the demo alone lol.
                                <br><br>
                                this game clearly has so much passion in it, evoking classic 3D platformers while also doing its own thing. i've considered writing about this game (and its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2985610/The_Big_Catch_Tacklebox/" target="_blank">free demo</a> which essentially is its own standalone game) but i think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbhSa0c4X5I" target="_blank">this video</a> sums up my thoughts!

                                a new Rhythm Heaven entry was another thing i kinda stopped expecting to happen, so i was super happy to see this get announced! we still barely know anything about the game so i just hope it keeps up the quality the previous entries had.

    <p>thats all for now! i've been slowly trying to build up the energy to be more productive, hopefully that can continue into the new year. i don't know if anyone really reads these posts, but thanks for reading if you have! these kinda things are nice to look back on, and at least stops me from doomscrolling or whatever else. hope you have a good year!  </p>
